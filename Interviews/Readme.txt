The Current COVID-19 pandemic changed everything. From the way we do business, congregate, transport and most specially the way we go to the doctor and take care of our health. This made Telemedicine one if not the way to move formward regarding simple patient care. So we decided to research what kind of solutions we are adopting.

Telemedicine software allows doctors to interact with patients via online video, which has been traditionally useful for practices with dispersed rural populations, including gaining access to specialists beyond what is locally available.

Sometimes telemedicine software is offered as a standalone platform, but these days it's not unusual to find it also provided within existing medical practice management (PM) software. Even standalone telemedicine platforms will often easily integrate with other medical software, such as for Electronic Health Records (EHR) or to make it easier to work with patient histories, making it easier to diagnose or treat medical conditions. (1).

But, thats where the problem starts. The sophistication of a system does not matter if few people are using it (at sometimes prohibitive costs) and it has no reach to zones where it was intended to operate. Also, Most systems are way too cumbersome to use have very old UI's and are not adaptable to modern needs.

To validate these past hypotheses we decided to do some field research and ask Medical Doctors from first hand several questiongs regarding their use of Telemedicine platforms and the way we can improve them.

We made a series of interviews with Medical Doctors between these ages:

We asked several questions regarding their use of telemedicine, current solutions and the way that they are employing them nowadays. These were the rough results:

We have to add that these test were performed with Doctors jusrt from Mexico City, where telehealth solutions are almost none-existent or have not reached the numbers that are needed today.
